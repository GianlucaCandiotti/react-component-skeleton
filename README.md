# React Component Skeleton

Base structure for a React Component looking to be published to npm. You may use it however you want though.

## Requirements

You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your development environment. Preferably a version above 4.0.0.

## Initializing

Just clone the project, run ```npm install``` and you are set to go.

## Folder Structure

- **/src**

  This folder is where most of the action happens. It will hold all of your source code, all the functionality and styles you intend to deliver as an encapsulated React Component.

  In the **js** folder (Well, in the whole project to be honest) you will find an already defined structure that works for me and some examples on how to do things. Just remove the examples or adapt them to your needs. Also you can change the structure as you please, just change the npm tasks accordingly.

  In the **scss** folder you can add the some basic styles for your Component. Try to not add styles that may be too restrictive or set the component to look certain way. Just write what's necessary to make it work.
